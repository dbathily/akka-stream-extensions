### Why

Akka-Stream Extensions is the result of our everyday work at [MfgLabs](http://mfglabs.com) using Akka-Stream in production. As often, we have discovered that some primitives weren't provided by Akka-Stream out of the box and we were re-using always the same low-level bricks to build higher-level Sources/Flows/Sinks.

Those generic elements have become so useful in our daily job but we also think that lots of people have the same requirements as us and would be pleased to use our toolings, improve them and contribute some others. Our aim is to contribute making the Akka-Stream ecosyste bigger, more efficient, more dynamic with many low-level to high-level tools.


MfgLabs has kindly accepted to opensource this library under Apache2 License making it really open & reusable in your professional projects.

We hope you will like this library and will contribute to it and help us.
